    People are individual users who are stored in the OSDI system’s
    database in some way.

    People have names, email addresses, and other information,
    and they have associated action histories recording the actions
    they’ve taken on the system, such as a list of their signatures
    on various petitions.

    Args:
        given_name (str)The person’s first name.
        family_name (str): The person’s last name.
        identifiers (List): A unique string array of identifiers in
            the format [system name]:[id]
        email_addresses (List): An array of email address object hashes
            associated with the person.
        phone_numbers (List): An array of phone number object hashes
            associated with the person.
        postal_addresses (List): An array of postal address object
            hashes associated with the person.
        _links (List): The links associated with this resource,
            available in the links section of the resource. Links
            that are part of the OSDI spec are typically prefixed
            with the osdi: namespace to aid in curie matching
            and readability.
        custom_fields (Dict): Key/value pairs associated with the
            person created by a user rather than a service or
            vendor.

    Attributes:
        given_name (str)The person’s first name.
        family_name (str): The person’s last name.
        identifiers (List): A unique string array of identifiers in
            the format [system name]:[id]
        email_addresses (List): An array of email address object hashes
            associated with the person.
        phone_numbers (List): An array of phone number object hashes
            associated with the person.
        postal_addresses (List): An array of postal address object
            hashes associated with the person.
